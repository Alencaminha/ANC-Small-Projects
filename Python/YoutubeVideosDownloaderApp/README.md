# Youtube Videos Downloader
## An app made with Tkinter for the GUI, and using the Pytube API/library for downloading the videos.
## This mini project was aimed on quickly learning how Tkinter works for creating GUI applications, and how Pytube works in general.

If I keep working on this in the future, this is what needs improvement the most:

- [ ] GUI appearence
- [ ] Preview some video informations
- [ ] Select resolution
- [ ] Select file path for the download
